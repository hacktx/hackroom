## Creating your 3D object file

First choose your 3D modeling tool. There are many different options out there and any of them will do.

[SketchUp] (http://www.sketchup.com/download) - A downloadable, powerful 3D modeling tool with many features.

[TinkerCad] (https://www.tinkercad.com/) - A simpler browser-based 3D modeling tool. 

A few tips to keep in mind when your designing your 3D object:

- __Thick Walls__ - Make the walls of your object a minimum of 1mm thick, otherwise your object will not be able to support itself. Thicker walls will make more complex structures easier to support.
- __Edges__ - Every edge on your object should have a minimum of two planes touching it in order for the printer to properly print the edge
- __Divide and Conquer__ - Design your object in small pieces, and break down components to simple geometric shapes before building upon them

Once you have finished creating your 3D Object export it into a .stl file and save it. You're now ready to start printing!

## Printing your 3D object

The first thing to consider before printing your object is the type of material being used (ABS vs PLA). Depending on the material the printer settings will vary slightly.

#### Temperature
__ABS__ - 235ºC to 256ºC nozzle
        
__ABS__ - 80ºC to 110ºC bed (ABS will bend under too much heat so it is best to turn down your bed temperature after the first few layers)

__PLA__ - 210ºC nozzle
        
__PLA__ - 40ºC to 50ºC bed

#### Supports and Rafts

- __Supports__ - If your 3D object has any overhangs or unsupported pieces it will require supports to print.
Supports are columns that are added in by the 3d printer in order to keep your object stable while printing.
These can be easily removed after the print by cutting them off. Any roughness from the support on your object can be fixed through sanding.
- __Rafts__ - If your 3D object does not have a flat base and is unable to sit on the bed of the printer then it will require a raft to print. Rafts are several flat layers that sit below your object that are required in order for your object to remain stable while printing. The can be easily removed after printing by cutting them off.

#### Printing

- __Nozzle__ - Choose the nozzle that you will like to print from. This will determine the color and type of material for your print. Typically these will be visible on the back side of the printer in order for you to choose from.

- __Time__ - After you have configured all your settings properly load your .stl file into the 3D printer and select it for print. Pay careful attention to the estimated time for your print. A quick way to shorten the print time is to reduce the scale of your object. This will require you to modify your 3D model accordingly and upload a new .stl file with the modified model.

- __Preheat__ -You can begin to preheat your printer as you configure your settings. It will take about 10 - 15 minutes for your printer to fully heat up. Make sure the door to the printer is sealed shut, so that minimal heat will escape during the print. 

You can now start the print!
