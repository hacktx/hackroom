## Creating your 3D object file

First choose your 3D modeling tool. There are many different options out there and any of them will do.

[SketchUp] (http://www.sketchup.com/download) - A downloadable, powerful 3D modeling tool with many features.

[TinkerCad] (https://www.tinkercad.com/) - A simpler browser-based 3D modeling tool. 

A few tips to keep in mind when your designing your 3D object:

- __Thick Walls__ - Make the walls of your object a minimum of 1mm thick, otherwise your object will not be able to support itself. Thicker walls will make more complex structures easier to support.
- __Edges__ - Every edge on your object should have a minimum of two planes touching it in order for the printer to properly print the edge
- __Divide and Conquer__ - Design your object in small pieces, and break down components to simple geometric shapes before building upon them

Once you have finished creating your 3D Object export it into a .stl file and save it. You're now ready to start printing!

## Printing your 3D object

The first thing to consider before printing your object is the type of material being used (ABS vs PLA). Depending on the material the printer settings will vary slightly.

#### Temperature
__ABS__ - 235ºC to 256ºC nozzle
        - 80ºC to 110ºC bed(ABS will bend under too much heat so it is best to turn down your bed temperature after the first few layers
